# No Priest Left Behind

[CSV data]() / [Interactive Leaflet map]()

This repository tracks all traditional Catholic or claiming-to-be-Catholic priests / bishops / sisters / 
brothers / monks / nuns, specifically ones that cannot be found using LatinMassDir or the SSPX Mass finder. 
Includes ex-SSPX, ex-FSSP, Resistance, ex-diocesan, sedevacantist, independent, ... priests including current 
location (lat / lon), current association, current position on Vatican II, etc. Also tracks traditional 
monasteries / convents, specifically ones that are found only on forums or through word-of-mouth.

For transparency, the different beliefs are listed in the "Beliefs" column, as well as the "Notes" column
(i.e. some people might say "priest X said Y, he's schismatic", "bishop line Y is invalid, don't list him as bishop": 
okay, we just document and track that, but we don't judge the validity / canonical status).

The only goal of this repository is to inform accurately about "what / where / when / general location", 
there is no discrimination of "X priest / group is schismatic" or "X bishops consecration was invalid", doubts 
are put in the "Notes" column, but overall the goal is just to track and map where (potentially valid) 
priests are. 

**Tracking does not mean validity of their sacraments or endorsment to go to their Masses**, but it happens a lot 
that priests just "disappear", change sides, go independent and, since they aren't listed on any larger
website (i.e. SSPX / FSSP), it's unclear what their belief and location is (i.e. LatinMassDir for example
discriminates against anyone "not in communion" with Rome).

List is community-maintained. If any information is inaccurate, please don't hesistate to make an issue.
